Instructions for running my Unity test harness tests
Adolfo Neto
September 20th, 2011


These tests are based on the tests presented by James Grenning in his book "Test Driven Development for Embedded C" (http://pragprog.com/book/jgade/test-driven-development-for-embedded-c).

1. Install Unity latest version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/unity/ 
2. Put the full path for the folder where you installed Unity in the "UNITY_FOLDER" variable on Makefile
3. Run the following
   $ make

The result should be something like that:

rm -f build/*.o ; rm -f stdio.out 
gcc -Isrc -I/home/adolfo/Dropbox/code/tdd_embedded_c/unity/src -I/home/adolfo/Dropbox/code/tdd_embedded_c/unity/extras/fixture/src -DTEST /home/adolfo/Dropbox/code/tdd_embedded_c/unity/src/unity.c test/stdio/SprintfTest.c test/stdio/no_ruby/SprintfTest_Runner.c -o stdio.out
stdio.out
test/stdio/SprintfTest.c:32:test_string_hey_is_as_expected:PASS
test/stdio/SprintfTest.c:37:test_string_hello_is_as_expected:PASS
