Learning Programming
====================

I use this repository to save the small programs I create when learning a programming language.



Languages I am learning
-----------------------

The following are the programming languages I am learning.

* [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) -- `A Lisp for the JVM`
* [Erlang](http://erlang.org/) -- `A programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.`
* [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) -- `An open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software.`
* [Unity](http://sourceforge.net/projects/unity/) -- `A unit test framework written entirely in the C language.`
